    "Paris": "Contrary to popular belief, the best views of Paris aren't from the Eiffel Tower (since you can't see the tower itself from there). Instead, head to Montparnasse Tower for the perfect cityscape including the Eiffel Tower.",
    "London": "Many of London's museums offer free admission, including world-class institutions like the British Museum, National Gallery, and Tate Modern. Plan your visits during weekday afternoons to avoid crowds.",
    "Barcelona": "Barcelona locals typically eat dinner after 9 PM, and many restaurants don't open for dinner until 8 PM. Adjust your schedule to experience authentic local dining.",
    "Rome": "The best time to visit Rome's popular attractions like the Colosseum and Vatican is during the first entry time slot or the last two hours before closing when crowds are significantly smaller."
